# Overview
ThresholdR uses Gaussian Mixture Models concept to identify the noise population in each surface marker across cells in CITE-seq experiments. Once the noise distribution is identified, it calculates the upper threshold of the noise component to separate expressing and non-expressing cells for each surface marker.
